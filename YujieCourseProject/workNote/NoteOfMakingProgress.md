- create a figure for the hybrid model using 
  * the input and TwHIN-Bert layer is done
    * whether the user and co-engagement (share, like, retweet, etc.) should be included for the input data?
    * Twitter heterogeneous information network is constructed and embedded first and act as the social objective for the downstream work, but we do not have data!
    * Still need to think about the LSTM layer, whether we should use multiple LSTM or bi-LSTM?
  * should I add diagram for BERT and LSTM architecture?
