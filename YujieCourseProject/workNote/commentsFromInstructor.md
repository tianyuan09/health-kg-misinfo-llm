# Feedback On Proposal
Good proposal.

- In the related work section, you were supposed to discuss the papers rather than simply provide their citations. To clarify, it would have been helpful to include a discussion on the input and output of the TwHIN-BERT-LSTM model.

- Also, what are the baseline models against which you will perform the comparison with TwHIN-BERT-LSTM?

- I look forward to seeing more details about the model and some initial results in the progress report.


# Feedback on Progress Report
- I suggest having a figure illustrating your hybrid approach. This figure can indicate the information such as input, the architecture of the hybrid model, output, loss, etc.

- In Table 3 and Table 4, I suggest limiting results to 2 to 3 decimal places.

- Good job on having results on two baseline models. I look forward to seeing how your hybrid method improves these results. In the final report, be sure to discuss the model in detail.

- For the final report, I suggest following (not copy) the writing style (for each section) of a related paper.
